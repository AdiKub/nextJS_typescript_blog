const PostCard = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>
      If you are passing
      </h3>
      <p>
      This is the most complex example where we have specific properties  the styling of the component and pass the rest of the required properties  the Header through. That means when you use Title it will have the  typing of both the styled requirements and the actual component  requirements. 
      </p>
    </div>
  )
} 

export default PostCard
